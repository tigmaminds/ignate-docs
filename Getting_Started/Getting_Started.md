# Getting Started with Ignate

Welcome to **Ignate Docs**. Ignate is a modern, cloud-native data platform designed to help you build, automate, and scale powerful **data workflows**. From ingestion to transformation to delivery, Ignate gives you a unified environment for orchestrating your organization‚Äôs data pipelines.

This guide will walk you through your first steps in Ignate: logging in, connecting data, and building your first workflow.

## Step 2: Connect Your First Data Source

Workflows start with data. Ignate supports databases, APIs, files, and streaming services.

1. Open the **Data Sources** section.
2. Select the connector for your system (SQL, API, CSV, cloud storage, etc.).
3. Provide connection details in the guided wizard.
4. Test the connection to confirm everything is working.

‚úÖ _You can connect multiple sources and reuse them across workflows._

---

## Step 3: Create Your First Workflow

A workflow defines **how data moves and transforms** in Ignate.

1. Navigate to the **Pipelines** section.
2. Click **Create New Pipeline** and give it a name.
3. Drag and drop nodes onto the canvas ‚Äî each node represents a task (e.g., filter, transformation, join etc).
4. Connect nodes to define the flow of data.
5. Configure node settings (queries, mappings, parameters).

‚ö° _Workflows can be scheduled, triggered by events, or run on-demand._

---

## Step 4: Run and Monitor

1. Save and run your workflow.
2. Watch logs and execution details in real time.
3. Verify outputs by checking the target system or storage.
4. Use built-in monitoring to track performance and data quality.

üîç _Errors are clearly surfaced so you can debug quickly._
